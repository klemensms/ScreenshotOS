# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Screenshot Library Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 4
# Priority: critical
# Description: Create a comprehensive screenshot library interface that serves as the main application view, displaying all captured screenshots in a visually appealing and highly performant gallery. Include thumbnail generation, sorting options, filtering capabilities, and batch operations.
# Details:
The screenshot library is the first thing users see when opening the app and provides a central hub for managing, tagging, filtering, and editing screenshots.

Core Requirements:
1. Visual gallery of thumbnails with efficient loading and virtualization for performance
2. Grid and list view options with smooth transitions
3. Chronological organization with day/week/month grouping
4. Sorting by date, name, application, or custom order
5. Preview functionality without opening the full editor
6. Batch selection for applying operations to multiple screenshots
7. Context menus for quick actions
8. Direct integration with the tagging system
9. Integration with the filtering system
10. Performance optimization for libraries with thousands of screenshots

Technical Considerations:
- Implement virtualized list for performance with large libraries
- Efficient thumbnail generation and caching
- Responsive design that adapts to window size
- Keyboard navigation and accessibility support
- Integration with the sidecar storage architecture
- Real-time updates when new screenshots are captured

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify all screenshots are displayed correctly in the library
2. Test thumbnail generation speed and quality
3. Validate grid and list view functionality
4. Check sorting options work correctly
5. Ensure batch operations function properly
6. Test with large libraries (1000+ screenshots) for performance
7. Validate keyboard navigation and accessibility
8. Test context menus and quick actions
9. Verify real-time updates when new screenshots are captured
10. Test on various screen sizes and resolutions
11. Measure loading and rendering performance

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Core Thumbnail Gallery Component [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the core thumbnail gallery component that will serve as the primary view for the screenshot library. This should include efficient rendering of thumbnails, virtualization for performance, and responsive layout options.
### Details:
1. Create a component for efficiently rendering screenshot thumbnails
2. Implement virtualized scrolling to handle large libraries
3. Support both grid and list view modes with smooth transitions
4. Add hover states with quick actions (preview, edit, delete, etc.)
5. Include visual indicators for tags and metadata
6. Implement responsive layout that works across different window sizes
7. Add keyboard navigation support
8. Optimize thumbnail generation and caching
9. Implement batch selection capability
10. Add context menus for quick actions

## 2. Implement Library Filtering System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a high-performance, real-time filtering system that allows users to quickly filter screenshots by tags, applications, date ranges, and other metadata, with results updating instantly as filters are applied or removed.
### Details:
1. Design a filtering UI that's always accessible in the library view
2. Implement tag-based filtering with visual indicators
3. Add application-based filtering from a dynamic list of detected applications
4. Implement date/time filtering with various granularity options (year, month, day)
5. Create a system for combining multiple filters with AND/OR logic
6. Add ability to save and recall filter combinations
7. Ensure filter operations complete in <100ms regardless of library size
8. Add visual feedback for active filters
9. Implement filter state persistence between sessions
10. Support keyboard shortcuts for common filter operations

## 3. Create Thumbnail Generation and Caching System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a thumbnail generation and caching system that efficiently creates, stores, and manages thumbnail images for all screenshots in the library. The system should balance quality and performance to ensure fast loading of the library view.
### Details:
1. Implement efficient thumbnail generation for various screenshot sizes and formats
2. Create a caching system to avoid regenerating thumbnails unnecessarily
3. Support progressive loading for large libraries
4. Add background processing for new screenshots while maintaining UI responsiveness
5. Implement thumbnail size options (small, medium, large)
6. Optimize memory usage for large libraries
7. Add support for high-DPI displays
8. Implement cache cleanup strategies to manage disk space
9. Add logic to regenerate thumbnails when originals are edited
10. Design the system to work with the sidecar storage architecture

## 4. Implement Batch Operations for Screenshot Management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement actions and controls for the library view that enable users to efficiently manage multiple screenshots at once. This includes selecting, tagging, moving, exporting, and deleting screenshots in batch operations.
### Details:
1. Implement multi-selection capabilities (click+drag, Ctrl/Cmd+click, etc.)
2. Create a selection indicator that shows the current number of selected items
3. Implement batch tagging functionality
4. Add batch export with format options
5. Create batch delete with confirmation
6. Implement batch move to collections
7. Add copy to clipboard for multiple items
8. Create a batch edit feature for common operations
9. Implement selection state persistence during filtering
10. Add keyboard shortcuts for selection operations

## 5. Implement Library-Editor Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement an integration system between the library and the editor to allow users to seamlessly transition from browsing screenshots to editing them, with changes immediately reflected back in the library view.
### Details:
1. Create a smooth transition from library view to editor
2. Implement a preview mode for quick edits without opening the full editor
3. Ensure real-time updates in the library when edits are saved
4. Add thumbnail refresh when screenshots are edited
5. Implement edit status indicators in the library view
6. Create context menu options for quick access to common edit functions
7. Add keyboard shortcuts for opening screenshots in the editor
8. Implement editor state persistence when navigating between screenshots
9. Add batch edit capability for applying the same edits to multiple screenshots
10. Create a recent edits section/filter in the library
