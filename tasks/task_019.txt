# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Customizable Keyboard Shortcuts
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a comprehensive system for customizable keyboard shortcuts that allows users to personalize how they interact with the application. Users should be able to define custom shortcuts for all capture modes and major functions, with support for profiles and conflict detection.
# Details:
Customizable shortcuts are critical for power users who want to optimize their workflow. This feature allows users to define their own keyboard combinations for triggering screenshots and other app functions.

Core Requirements:
1. Support for custom keyboard shortcuts across all app functions
2. UI for viewing and editing keyboard shortcuts
3. Shortcut profiles for different workflows or users
4. Intelligent conflict detection with other system shortcuts
5. Support for complex key combinations
6. Global and application-specific shortcuts
7. Import/export functionality for sharing configurations
8. Default shortcut sets that users can revert to
9. Visual keyboard layout for easier configuration
10. Persistence of shortcut settings across app updates

Technical Considerations:
- Cross-platform compatibility considerations
- Secure storage of shortcut configurations
- Performance impact of shortcut listener implementation
- Accessibility support
- Internationalization for different keyboard layouts

# Test Strategy:
1. Test shortcut registration across different keyboard layouts
2. Verify conflict detection with system shortcuts
3. Validate profile switching functionality
4. Test import/export of configurations
5. Verify persistence across app restarts and updates
6. Test with various key combinations including modifiers
7. Validate accessibility compliance
8. Performance test to ensure minimal impact on app responsiveness
9. Test global and application-specific shortcuts
10. Verify internationalization support for different keyboard layouts

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Core Shortcut Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a core system for registering, detecting, and handling global keyboard shortcuts that can be customized by the user. This system should efficiently capture key combinations and manage their associations with app actions.
### Details:
1. Design a keyboard shortcut listener system
2. Implement key combination detection with modifier support (Cmd, Ctrl, Shift, Alt, etc.)
3. Create a mapping system between shortcuts and application actions
4. Add support for shortcut validation and conflict detection
5. Implement shortcut persistence across app sessions
6. Create a system for default shortcuts
7. Add support for shortcut profiles
8. Implement app-specific shortcut context switching
9. Optimize performance to ensure minimal latency
10. Add logging and debugging capabilities

## 2. Design Shortcut Configuration Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a user interface for viewing and customizing keyboard shortcuts. This UI should make it easy for users to see current shortcuts, modify them, and manage shortcut profiles.
### Details:
1. Create a dedicated shortcuts settings panel
2. Design an intuitive UI for displaying current shortcut mappings
3. Implement a shortcut editor with key capture functionality
4. Add visual feedback for conflict detection
5. Create a visual keyboard layout for easier configuration
6. Implement profile management UI (create, rename, delete profiles)
7. Add import/export functionality for sharing configurations
8. Include a 'reset to defaults' option
9. Design an accessible interface that works with keyboard navigation
10. Add search/filter capabilities for finding specific shortcuts

## 3. Implement System-Level Shortcut Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement system-level integration for global shortcuts that works across different platforms. This should detect and handle conflicts with existing system and application shortcuts.
### Details:
1. Implement platform-specific shortcut registration (macOS, future Windows)
2. Create a system for detecting conflicts with OS-level shortcuts
3. Add application-level shortcut context awareness
4. Implement a permission system for global shortcut registration
5. Add fallback mechanisms for when shortcuts can't be registered
6. Create a notification system for shortcut conflicts
7. Implement an advisory system for suggesting alternative shortcuts
8. Add logging for shortcut registration/unregistration
9. Create a recovery system for handling registration failures
10. Optimize for minimal performance impact

## 4. Implement Shortcut Profile Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a profile management system that allows users to create, switch between, and share different shortcut configurations for different workflows or users.
### Details:
1. Implement a data model for shortcut profiles
2. Create functionality to create, rename, and delete profiles
3. Add profile switching with immediate application
4. Implement profile import/export functionality
5. Create a default profile that can't be deleted
6. Add profile metadata (name, description, last modified, etc.)
7. Implement profile version management for backward compatibility
8. Create a profile backup system
9. Add profile sharing capabilities
10. Implement per-profile conflict detection

## 5. Implement Performance Testing and Optimization for Shortcuts [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement performance testing and optimization for the shortcut system to ensure it doesn't negatively impact core application performance, particularly the critical sub-100ms capture response time.
### Details:
1. Create a performance testing methodology for shortcut registration and detection
2. Measure impact on application startup time
3. Analyze memory usage with various shortcut configurations
4. Test performance with large numbers of custom shortcuts
5. Optimize shortcut listener to minimize CPU usage
6. Measure latency impact on critical capture operations
7. Implement benchmarking for different shortcut registration methods
8. Create performance reports and optimization recommendations
9. Implement automatic performance degradation detection
10. Add safeguards to prevent performance-impacting shortcut configurations
